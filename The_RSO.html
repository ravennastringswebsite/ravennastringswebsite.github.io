The Ravenna Strings is conducted by <a href="conductors.html">Joseph Pollard White</a>. It is usually more advanced and focusses on repertoire. There are no auditions and all ages (over 13) are welcome. Rehearsals are informal and low pressure, however, members of the orchestra are serious about preparing for the short concerts which conclude each quarter. 
<br><br>

Rehearsals are on Thursday evenings, 7:00 - 8:15 p.m., at the
<a href="http://www.phinneycenter.org"> Phinney Center </a> 6532 Phinney Ave. N, Seattle. 
<br><br>

There is a fee of $150/term regular, $90/term reduced (student, senior, etc.) There is also a 'Pay what you wish' option. No one will ever not be allowed to participate due to finances. <a href="register.html">REGISTER</a>
