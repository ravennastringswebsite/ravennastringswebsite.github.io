        One day Lorraine Hughes (pictured left) and
        Judy Drake walked their dogs around Green Lake. They discussed
        what they might do upon retirement. One idea was to lick
        envelopes; the other was to start a community orchestra.
        They chose the second alternative and began immediately.
        <br><br>

        The Ravenna String Orchestra was organized in 1996. As the
        membership grew and the players became more advanced, a
        second orchestra was begun at Langston Hughes Center for
        the Arts in 2000. This orchestra later gravitated to the
        Ravenna-Eckstein Community Center where it became known as
        the Ravenna Second String Orchestra.
        <br><br>

        After COVID-19, the Ravenna Strings re-grouped under the leadership of Joseph Pollard White. Rehearsals are at the <a href="http://www.phinneycenter.org"> Phinney Center </a> 6532 Phinney Ave. N, Seattle. There are three sessions each year in the Fall, Winter and Spring, each followed by a concert. Concerts are at various locations, most recently
        <a href="http://saintandrewsseattle.org"> St. Andrew's Episcopal Church </a> 111 NE 80th St., Seattle.

        <br><br>
        Judy Drake, violinist/conductor, was the director from the
        founding of the orchestra through February 2017.
        <br><br>
        Lorraine Hughes was the co-director/pianist through
        February 2017.
        <br><br>
        Joseph Pollard White, director since 2017, conducts the Thursday night group, the Ravenna Strings.
        <br><br>
        Nathan Harrison, associate director, conducts the Monday night group, the Ravenna Second Strings.
        <br><br>
        In 2022, Ravenna Strings was incorporated as a non-profit corporation in the State of Washington
