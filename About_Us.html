One day Lorraine Hughes (pictured left) and
              Judy Drake walked their dogs around Green Lake. They discussed
              what they might do upon retirement. One idea was to lick
              envelopes; the other was to start a community orchestra.
              They chose the second alternative and began immediately.</font><font

              The Ravenna String Orchestra was organized in 1996. As the
              membership grew and the players became more advanced, a
              second orchestra was begun at Langston Hughes Center for
              the Arts in 2000. This orchestra later gravitated to the
              Ravenna-Eckstein Community Center where it became known as
              the Ravenna Second String Orchestra. <br><br>

After COVID-19, the Ravenna Strings re-grouped under the leadership of Joseph Pollard White. Rehearsals are at the <a href="http://www.phinneycenter.org"> Phinney Center </a> 6532 Phinney Ave. N, Seattle. There are three sessions each year in the Fall, Winter and Spring, each followed by a concert. Concerts are at various locations, most recently

              Judy Drake, violinist/conductor, was the director from the
              founding of the orchestra through February 2017. <br>
              <br>
              Lorraine Hughes was the co-director/pianist through
              February 2017.<br>
