# Welcome to the Ravenna String Orchestras!

Our mission is to provide string players at all levels (over age 13) a welcoming, low-pressure opportunity to make music with wonderful people and explore great repertoire. We're perfect for musicians wanting to keep up their skills or get back into playing after taking some time off.

## Our Groups

We currently offer two groups:

- **The Ravenna String Sinfonia** (Monday group) is directed by Nathan Harrison and is at a beginner/intermediate level, focusing a little more on technique and musicianship.
- **The Ravenna Strings** (Thursday group) is directed by Joseph Pollard White and is at an intermediate/advanced level, focusing a little more on repertoire.

**There are no auditions.** Musicians are invited to choose whichever group suits their needs. Some folks go back and forth between groups (and some even do both!)

## Rehearsal Information

We rehearse at the [Phinney Neighborhood Center](https://www.phinneycenter.org/about/locations), 6532 Phinney Ave. N in Seattle from 7pm to 8:15pm. There is parking at the Center and some on the street. It is well served by Metro bus line 5.

We offer 3 terms (Fall, Winter, Spring) with a joint free concert at the end of each term. Check our [Concerts and Schedules](/concerts) page for the latest rehearsal schedule and concert information.

Our concerts this year will be at [St. Andrew's Church](https://saintandrewsseattle.org) 111 NE 80th St. in Seattle.
