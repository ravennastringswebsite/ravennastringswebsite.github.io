        Our mission is to provide string players at all levels (over age 13) a welcoming, low-pressure opportunity to make music with wonderful people and explore great repertoire. We're perfect for musicians wanting to keep up their skills or get back into playing after taking some time off.
        <br><br>
        We currently offer two groups. The Monday group (Ravenna Second Strings) is directed by <a href="conductors.html">Nathan Harrison</a> and is at a beginner/intermediate level, focussing a little more on technique and musicianship. The Thursday group (Ravenna Strings) is directed by <a href="conductors.html">Joseph Pollard White</a> and is at an intermediate/advanced level, focussing a little more on repertoire.
        <br><br>
        <strong>There are no auditions.</strong> Musicians are invited to choose whichever group suits their needs. Some folks go back and forth between groups (and some even do both!)
        <br><br>
        We rehearse at the <a href="https://www.phinneycenter.org/about/locations">Phinney Neighborhood Center</a>, 6532 Phinney Ave. N in Seattle from 7pm to 8:15pm. There is parking at the Center and some on the street. It is well served by Metro bus line 5. We offer 3 terms (Fall, Winter, Spring) with a joint free concert at the end of each term.
        <br><br>
        This Fall, the Monday group will start on September 11, 2023. The Thursday group will start the following week on September 21. Our free Fall concert will be Wednesday November 15 at 7:30pm at <a href="https://saintandrewsseattle.org">St. Andrew's Church</a> 111 NE 80th St. in Seattle.
        <br><br>
        The fee to participate is: $150/term regular, $90/term reduced (student, senior, etc.) There is also a 'Pay what you wish' option. <strong>No one will ever not be allowed to participate due to finances.</strong> <a href="register.html">REGISTER</a>
        <br><br>
        We are a non-profit, 501(c)3 organization. Donations help us keep our fees low and are tax-deductible. <a href="donate.html">DONATE</a>
